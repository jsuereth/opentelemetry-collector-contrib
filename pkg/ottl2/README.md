# OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (internal architecture revamp)
<!-- status autogenerated section -->
<!-- end autogenerated section -->

The OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL) is a small, domain-specific programming language intended to process data with OpenTelemetry-native concepts and constructs.

This package implements everything necessary to use OTTL in a Collector component or in another user-facing system.

## Getting Started

TBD: Update from previous

## Where to use OTTL

- To modify your data as it passes through a pipeline, use the [transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor/README.md).
- To remove data from your pi

- To select spans to be sampled, use the [tail sampling processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor/README.md).
- To route data between pipelines, use the [routing connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/connector/routingconnector/README.md).
